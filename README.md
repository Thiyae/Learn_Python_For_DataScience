Data Science with Python Libraries

Overview

This repository documents my journey of learning and mastering Python libraries for data science. It includes Jupyter notebooks, code examples, and datasets demonstrating key concepts and techniques using libraries like NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, along with practical projects and data files.

Purpose

The goal of this repository is to serve as a personal knowledge base and a resource for others interested in data science with Python. It reflects my progression through various topics, showcasing hands-on applications, problem-solving techniques, and best practices using the included files.

Contents

Jupyter Notebooks:

learn_data_visualisation.ipynb:
Explores data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
learn_dealing_with_missing_values.ipynb: 
Covers methods to handle missing data in datasets.
learn_eda.ipynb:
Focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
learn_numpy.ipynb:
Demonstrates NumPy for numerical computations and array operations.
learn_pandas.ipynb:
Showcases pandas for data manipulation and analysis.


Datasets:

Toyota.csv:
A dataset for practicing data analysis and visualization.
new_cars_data.csv:
Contains data for exploring car-related attributes.
student.csv and student.xlsx:
Datasets for student-related analysis.
updated_cars.csv: An updated version of car data for further analysis.


Additional Files:
new_cars_data:
A folder potentially containing additional car data resources.
